    <h1>My C++ Experience</h1>
    <h2>When It Started</h2>
    <p>I started learning C++ in late July of 2022. I started learning C++
      because I was going to have a class starting in August called "Programming
      Fundamentals" and I didn't know what language(s) it was over at the time.
      I thought that C++ would be a very good language to learn to continue from
      Python as it was also a very popular well known language. As it turned out,
      the class ended up being focused solely on the C++ programming language
      and by learning it for a couple of weeks in the summer I had a big head
      start on a lot of material gone over in class. I continue using C++ in
      class to this day.
      </p>

      <h2>My C++ Projects</h2>
      <p>I have used C++ to code many programs now, however, they are typically
         small and not anything worth mentioning on their own. There is only one
         project that I have done that actually took a good period of time to
         complete and that I was proud of after its completion.

             <h3>Go Fish!</h3>
             <p>
               Go Fish is the biggest project I have done in C++ thus far. It
               uses many of the capabilities I have learned. In the
               program I utilize functions, pointers, vectors, and strings. I
               also had to create a computer that would know how to ask for
               cards out of its hand as well.
