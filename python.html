    <h1>My Python Experience</h1>
    <h2>When It Started</h2>
    <p>
      I learned the very basiscs of print statements, if statements, and
      how to receive user input in Python 2 a few years ago. I made a simple
      program utilizing these features and then didn't touch Python again
      for a while after that. The next time I did use Python again was in
      October 2021 when I had to use Python 3 for a small project in my
      Practicum of Information Technology class at Burleson High School.
      After doing that project, I started to want to learn more of Python but I
      didn't know how to go about it yet. Then, a few months later, in March
      2022, I started learning through a video course on Udemy. After doing this
      course for a few months, I have gotten the chance to greatly expand my
      knowledge on Python as well as increase the amount of projects that I
      have been able to do.

          <h3>Rock Paper Scissors</h3>
          <p>Created just a couple of days after I started my Python course, Rock
            Paper Scissors becomes the first game I have ever programmed. It may be
            simple, but it was stil an important step in my Python learning journey.
            The game operates in the Python Console and displays ASCII art of
            the hands forming the rock, paper, and scissors hand gestures
            typically done in game. The game was updated after it was originally
            made to add a looping feature and to display the total wins, losses,
            and ties.</p>

          <h3>Hangman</h3>
          <p>
            Shortly after the development of my first game, came the making of
            my second game, Hangman. Much like the game before it, Hangman was
            not too complicated and operated solely though text within the
            Python Console. It displayed ASCII art and kept track of used
            letters and words guessed while displaying all progress to the user.

          <h3>Blackjack</h3>
          <p>
            Another few days after my second game, I was already programming
            another game for Python Console. This game was a definitely more
            complicated than another other program I have made leading up to it.
            I had to code it to know when the game should automatically end,
            when to convert an Ace the value of 11 to a value of 1, and create
            a dealer with at least a little intelligence to draw cards until
            reaching a sufficient point.

    <p>The first version of my Trivia Quiz was done in Python Console with the
    same selection of questions each time. The second version was done in a GUI
    provided by Tkinter and also received new questions each time from an API.</p>

          <h3>Snake</h3>
          <p>
            Snake was the first actual game I made with a GUI (Python Turtle Graphics)
            and not in Python Console. Was also the first to write data to a
            file and retrieve the data next time it runs, used this feature to
            save highscore.

            This game was also made with Python Turtle Graphics and features a
            turtle that is tring to reach the top of the screen to go to the
            next level. In the middle of the screen, however, there is an area
            with many cars going from right to left and that get progressively
            quicker as the level increases.
