    <h1>My C Experience</h1>
    <h2>When It Started</h2>
    <p>I started leaning C a little bit after I began to learn C++ due to a
      discrepancy in the description of my programmin course. When I read the
      descrption of my course it said the language of focus was C. Becuase of
      this, I began to learn C in preparation for my class. In reality, however,
      the programming language my coures was focused on was C++. Due to this
      simple inconsistency in the description, I went on to learn many of the
      basic principals of C with me even getting to start understanding
      recursion functions as well as creating my own structs as the last thing
      I was doing.</p>

      <h2>My C Projects</h2>
      <p>Simlar to C++, I have had many programs made with C but most arn't
        noteworthy. There is however, one decent project that took more time
        than any other project to complete as well as the most code.</p>

              <h3>Fraction Calculator</h3>
              <p>
                My Fraction Calculator program utilizes a new type of struct
                called Fraction that holds 2 integers for the numerator and the
                denominator. The program can then do many types of operations
                onto the fractions stored in it.
