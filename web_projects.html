    <h1>My Website Development Experience</h1>
    <h2>When It Started</h2>
    <p>I started learning how to use HTML to make website in October 2022. In
      that same month, I also started leanring how to use CSS to style websites.
      I started learning web development for no reason other than peronal
      interest, I had no class I was doing for it but was just going through an
      online video course at my own desired pace.

    <h2>Website Projects</h2>
    <p>There is only one website that I have been developing so far in my website
       development journey, and that is this current website that is all about
       me.</p>
